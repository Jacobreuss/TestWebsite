# Scroll-Driven Video Animation Website

## Setup
1. Copy your video file (`Animation_test.mp4`) into this project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## How it works
- As you scroll, the video plays in sync with your scroll position.
- When the video is finished, you can scroll to see the content below.

## Customization
- To use a different video, replace `Animation_test.mp4` with your own file and update the `src` in `index.html` if needed.
- Adjust the `.video-spacer` height in `style.css` to control how much scrolling is needed to play the video.
